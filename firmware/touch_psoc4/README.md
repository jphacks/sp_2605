# PSOC&trade; 4: MSCLP capacitive and inductive sensing buttons

This code example demonstrates the implementation of inductive sensing based touch-over-metal (ToM) keypad buttons using SmartSense along with a CSD button and a CSX button on a PSOC&trade; 4 device featuring fifth-generation CAPSENSE&trade; multi-sense converter low power (MSCLP) technology. 

The example showcases methods to configure and scan both inductive and capacitive sensing based buttons together, and uses the CAPSENSE&trade; MSCLP to demonstrate different considerations to implement such a design.

### Monitor data using CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner

1. Open the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner from the **Tools** section in the IDE Quick Panel

   You can also run the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner application standalone from *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/capsense-configurator/capsense-tuner*. In this case, after opening the application, select **File** > **Open** and open the *design.cycapsense* file of the respective application, which is located in the *{Application root directory}/bsps/TARGET_APP_\<BSP-NAME>/config* folder

   See the [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*) for options to open the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner application using the CLI

2. Ensure that the status LED is ON and not blinking; as it indicates that the onboard KitProg3 is in CMSIS-DAP Bulk mode. See the [Firmware-loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) to learn how to update the firmware and switch modes in KitProg3

3. In the tuner application, click on the **Tuner Communication Setup** icon or select **Tools** > **Tuner Communication Setup** as shown in **Figure 3**

   **Figure 3. Tuner communication setup**

   <img src="images/tuner-comm-setup.png" width="300" /> 

   Select I2C under KitProg3 and configure it as follows:

   - **I2C address:** 8
   - **Sub-address:** 2-Bytes
   - **Speed (kHz):** 400

   These are the same values set in the EZI2C resource as shown in **Figure 4**

   **Figure 4. Tuner Communication Setup parameters**

   <img src="images/tuner-comm-settings.png" width="450"/>

4. Click **Connect** or select **Communication** > **Connect** to establish a connection

   **Figure 5. Establish connection**

   <img src="images/tuner-connect.png" width="300" />

5. Click **Start** or select **Communication** > **Start** to begin data streaming from the device

   **Figure 6. Start Tuner communication**

   <img src="images/tuner-start.png" width="300" />

   The **Widget/Sensor Parameters** tab is updated with the parameters configured in the **CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator** window. The tuner displays the data from the sensor in the **Widget View** and **Graph View** tabs

6. Set the **Read mode** to **Synchronized mode**. Navigate to the **Widget view** tab and notice that the pressed widget is highlighted in **blue** as shown in **Figure 7**. The CAPSENSE&trade; buttons are tuned to respond to a light finger touch. The ISX buttons are tuned to respond to a finger press with a 3N force

   **Figure 7. Widget view of the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner**

   <img src="images/tuner-widget-view.png" width=""/>

7. Go to the **Graph View** tab to view the raw count, baseline, difference count, and status of each sensor. To view the sensor data for the different ISX buttons, select ISX_Button1_Rx0_Lx0 under ISX_Button1 and so on, respectively (see **Figure 8**). Similarly for the CAPSENSE&trade; buttons, select the CSD_Button_Sns0 under CSD_Button and so forth.

   **Figure 8. Graph view of the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner for the ISX button**

   <img src="images/tuner-graph-view-intro.png" width=""/>

8. Switch to the **SNR Measurement** tab for measuring the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and verify that the SNR is greater than 10:1, and the signal count is above 50; select the **ISX_Button1** widget and **ISX_Button1_Rx0_Lx0** sensor, and then click **Acquire noise** as shown in **Figure 9**

   **Figure 9. CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner - SNR measurement: Acquire noise**

   <img src="images/tuner-acquire-noise.png" width=""/>
    
   <br>

9. Once the noise is acquired, press the finger at the required position on the button and click **Acquire signal**. Ensure that the finger remains on the button as long as the signal acquisition is in progress. Observe that the SNR is greater than 10:1 and the signal count is above '50'

   The calculated SNR on this button is displayed as shown in **Figure 10**. Based on the end system design, test the signal with a finger press force that matches the size and pressure of a normal use case. Also, test using lighter presses that will be rejected by the system to ensure that they do not reach the finger threshold. Use a force meter to apply the required force
   
   **Figure 10. CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner - SNR measurement: Acquire signal**

   <img src="images/tuner-acquire-signal.png" width=""/>
   
   <br>

   **Table 2. SNR values for the regular widgets for the keypad-4 board**

   Sensor | SNR for 3N force / 6 mm button press as applicable
   :---------------------| :-----
   ISX_Button1  | 42
   ISX_Button2  | 16
   ISX_Button3  | 51
   ISX_Button4  | 66
   CSD_Button   | 5.8
   CSX_Button   | 7.7
   
   <br>
   
   > **Note:** For the CAPSENSE&trade; buttons, a metal finger of 6 mm diameter has been used for tuning


### Scanning ISX, CSD, and CSX sensors

As per CAPSENSE&trade; middleware errata [17158](https://infineon.github.io/capsense/capsense_api_reference_manual/html/index.html#section_capsense_errata), the ISX scan followed by BIST measurement or with other sensing methods CSD and CSX introduces a drift in raw count, which impacts the performance and accuracy of the ISX scanning.

These are the possible workarounds:

1. Use ISX in stand-alone mode without other sensing methods. The code example uses the `Cy_CapSense_ScanSlots()` API to do this. The ISX sensors are scanned separately from the CSD and CSX sensors

   ```
   /*Scan all slots corresponding to the ISX buttons*/
   Cy_CapSense_ScanSlots(0u,4u,&cy_capsense_context);
   while(Cy_CapSense_IsBusy(&cy_capsense_context)){}

   /*Scan the slots corresponding to the CSD button*/
   Cy_CapSense_ScanSlots(4u,1u,&cy_capsense_context);
   while(Cy_CapSense_IsBusy(&cy_capsense_context)){}

   /*Scan the slots corresponding to the CSX button*/
   Cy_CapSense_ScanSlots(5u,1u,&cy_capsense_context);
   while(Cy_CapSense_IsBusy(&cy_capsense_context)){}
   ```

2. Use ISX without built-in self-test (BIST) as done in this example

3. Configure the inactive sensor connection parameter to High-Z for the ISX scanning. This is the default configuration when the ISX sensors are scanned

4. Introduce a dummy scan before ISX. This can be done by increasing the number of init sub-conversions via the CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator as shown in **Figure 11**

   **Figure 11. Increasing init sub-conversions via CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator**

### Tuning procedure

<details><summary><b>Create a custom BSP for your board</b></summary>

1. Create a custom BSP for your board having any device, by following the steps given in the [ModusToolbox&trade; BSP Assistant user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxBSPAssistant)

2. Open the *design.modus* file from *{Application root directory}/bsps/TARGET_APP_\<BSP-NAME>/config* folder obtained in the previous step and enable CAPSENSE&trade; to get the *design.cycapsense* file. CAPSENSE&trade; configuration can then be started from scratch as follows:
</details>

<br>

> **Note:** See the "Tuning the inductive-sensing solution" section in the [AN239751 – Flyback inductive sensing (ISX) design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN239751) and the "Selecting CAPSENSE&trade; hardware parameters" section in [AN85951 – PSOC&trade; 4 and PSOC&trade; 6 CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951) to learn about the considerations for selecting each parameter value.

See the following code examples to learn more about the tuning flow for the different widgets:

- [PSOC&trade; 4: MSCLP inductive sensing touch-over-metal keypad-4 demo](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-msclp-isx-tom-keypad-4-buttons-demo)
- [PSOC&trade; 4: MSCLP low-power self-capacitance button](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-msclp-low-power-csd-button)
- [PSOC&trade; 4: MSCLP low-power mutual-capacitance button](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc4-msclp-low-power-csx-button)

## Operation at other voltages

[CY8CPROTO-041TP kit](https://www.infineon.com/CY8CPROTO-041TP) supports operating voltages of 1.8 V, 3.3 V, and 5 V. See the [kit user guide](https://www.infineon.com/002-40273) to set the preferred operating voltage and see section [Setup the VDDA supply voltage and debug mode in Device Configurator](#set-up-the-vdda-supply-voltage-and-debug-mode-in-device-configurator).

The functionalities of this application is optimally tuned for 5 V, which is the default operating voltage for this kit. Observe that the basic functionalities work across other voltages.

For optimal performance, it is recommended to repeat the tuning procedure if the operating voltage is changed from default.

# Debugging

You can debug this project to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

## Design and implementation

The design has an implementation of the following sensors:
- Four inductive sensing based button widgets (4 elements)
- One self-capacitance based button configured as a regular widget (called "Button" in the CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator) in the CSD-RM sensing mode
- One mutual-capacitance based button configured as a regular widget (called "Button" in the CAPSENSE&trade; Configurator) in the CSX-RM sensing mode

Following are the six LEDs used in this project: 
- LEDs D0 to D3 show the ISX buttons' touch status. They are turned ON when the corresponding button is pressed and turned OFF when the finger is lifted.
- LED 3 shows the CSD button touch status. It is turned ON when the CSD button is touched and turned OFF when the finger is lifted.
- LED 2 shows the CSX button touch status. It is turned ON when the CSX button is touched and turned OFF when the finger is lifted.

The project uses the [CAPSENSE&trade; middleware](https://github.com/Infineon/capsense) (see [ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserguide) for more details on selecting a middleware). See [AN85951 – PSOC&trade; 4 and PSOC&trade; 6 MCU CAPSENSE&trade; design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN85951) and [AN239751 - Flyback inductive sensing (ISX) design guide](https://www.infineon.com/AN239751) for more details on CAPSENSE&trade; features and usage.

The [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) provides a GUI-based tuner application for debugging and tuning the CAPSENSE&trade; system. The CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner application works with EZI2C and UART communication interfaces. This project has a Serial Communication Block (SCB) configured in EZI2C mode to establish communication with the onboard KitProg, which in turn enables reading the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data using the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner. See **Figure 13** in [Resources and settings](#resources-and-settings) section for the EZI2C settings used in this code example.

The CAPSENSE&trade; data structure that contains the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data is exposed to the CAPSENSE&trade; Tuner by setting up the I2C communication data buffer with the CAPSENSE&trade; data structure. This enables the tuner to access the CAPSENSE&trade; raw data for tuning and debugging CAPSENSE&trade;.


### Set up the VDDA supply voltage and Debug mode in Device Configurator

1. Open **Device Configurator** from the Quick Panel

2. Go to the **System** tab, select the **Power** resource, and set the VDDA value under **Operating conditions** as shown in **Figure 12**
